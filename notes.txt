Things that I need to do

[x] Move the jwt template into create react app
[x] Create consistency in the imports
[ ] start working towards a landing page, sign up, log in, and a private view

import all the todos from previous notes.txt

why does children have to be wrapped in an object to be passed to a component?
({children}) => component()

-start with the dependencies
redux, react-redux, react-router-dom, redux-logger, redux-thunk, history

-imports and exports, get it done

I'm starting to see how keeping the index.js file in the dir makes imports easier
doing an export default will return that one thing
when it is imported, it can be named to anything, hmm.. this leaves room for error, should be stricter
so doing the index.js to export things and using export { this as that } on import must do { item } from <directory>, pretty cool

Things to look into
-Kubernetes
