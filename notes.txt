Things that I need to do

[x] A sign up page, will be similar to login
[x] Have all pages inherit from one base page
[x] Move the jwt template into create react app
[x] Create consistency in the imports
[x] Move the project to create-react-app boiler plate

DO THIS
END GOAL -> landing page, sign up, log in, and a private view
[x] when dev tools is opened, site disappears, wut => had to do with the Responsive component
[ ] mave alerts to under the nave bar and style it
[ ] add in some validation when the forms are submitted
[ ] add value attributes to the form inputs

[ ] Add a 404 page for routes that don't exists
[ ] Fix exports, too verbose...

Problems
Once you apply 'connect' to a component, it gets the dispatch func?

why does children have to be wrapped in an object to be passed to a component?
({children}) => component()

-imports and exports, get it done

I'm starting to see how keeping the index.js file in the dir makes imports easier
doing an export default will return that one thing
when it is imported, it can be named to anything, hmm.. this leaves room for error, should be stricter
so doing the index.js to export things and using export { this as that } on import must do { item } from <directory>, pretty cool

think I just found out about object destructuring with { field1, field2, .. } = object


Things to look into
-Kubernetes


Things that I learn as I implement these things

Things to keep in mind
-Good commit history
-Readme file
-File structure
-Documentation
-Code consistency
-Attribute other people's code
-Tests
